I am starting my web development journey today. I am aiming to start my own business in February 2023.

**My roadmap is as follows:** 

1) June 2022 - I will spend the all month learning about html, css and how to use 			**Bootstrap** as a front-end development framework for websites and webb applications. 

2) July 2022 - I will dive into **Django** and incorporation of **databases** in my web apps. 

3) August 2022 - I will create a personal portfolio website,start to build my personal brand and read about freelancing fundamentals and business essentials. 

4) September 2022 - I will get my first paid project. 


**Disclamer:**

I will be doing all this stuff on my free time (evenings and weekends) so that it **does not** interfere with my job as a bioinformatician.
